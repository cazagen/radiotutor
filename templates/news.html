	<h2>Latest Updates from RadioTutor</h2><br>
	
	<h3>New Courses</h3>
	<p>Hello all, I have started to write brand new courses for RadioTutor! At first I will be focusing on the Intermediate licence,
	followed by Foundation and then Advanced. Hopefully over the coming weeks you should see lots of content filling up the courses,
	including videos and quizzes.</p>

	<h3>New Site</h3>
	<p>Welcome to RadioTutor, a new site to help you study for your UK Foundation, Intermediate and Advanced exams.
	This website has been made possible by the authors of hamtests.co.uk, who generously provided their pool of questions
	for use on this site. We are currently still actively developing this site, so please be patient as changes and updates roll out.</p>
